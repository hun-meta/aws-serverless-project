âœ¦ Here is an analysis of the CDK project and a guide for understanding it.

  Potential Issues

  Based on an analysis of the project structure and configuration, here are some potential areas for improvement and investigation:


   1. Missing Tests: The package.json includes a test script with jest, but there are no test files within the project. This makes it
      risky to modify or refactor the infrastructure code without a way to verify its behavior.
   2. Security of IAM and Security Groups: The project defines IAM roles and security groups in lib/stacks/iam-stack.ts and
      lib/stacks/security-group-stack.ts. It is crucial to review the permissions and rules within these stacks to ensure they adhere to
      the principle of least privilege and do not expose the infrastructure to unnecessary risks. For example, overly permissive ingress
      rules on security groups (like allowing 0.0.0.0/0 for SSH) can be a significant vulnerability.
   3. Environment Configuration: The cdk.json file defines dev and prod environments, but the application entrypoint (bin/cdk-prj.ts)
      does not appear to have a robust mechanism for managing environment-specific configurations beyond terminationProtection. As the
      application grows, a more structured approach to managing configuration differences between environments will be necessary.
   4. Hardcoded Values: There are hardcoded values in bin/cdk-prj.ts for application tagging. These would be better managed in a
      centralized configuration file.
   5. Lack of Documentation: The lambda/functions/health-check directory, which contains a Lambda function, lacks a README.md file. This
      makes it difficult for new developers to understand the function's purpose, how to run it locally, or any deployment-specific
      details.

  Step-by-Step Guide for Analysis


  For someone new to this project, here is a recommended approach to understanding it:


   1. Start at the Entrypoint: The cdk.json file's "app" key points to bin/cdk-prj.ts. This is the main entry point for the CDK
      application, where all the stacks are instantiated and configured.
   2. Understand Environment Configuration: The bin/cdk-prj.ts file uses a getEnvironmentConfig utility from lib/utils/environment.ts.
      Examine this file to understand how the dev and prod environments are configured and how environment-specific parameters are
      loaded.
   3. Follow the Stack Creation: The bin/cdk-prj.ts file creates all the infrastructure stacks in a specific order and defines their
      dependencies. Follow this flow to get a high-level overview of the architecture.
   4. Examine Each Stack: Go through each stack file in the lib/stacks/ directory. For each stack, focus on:
       * The AWS resources it creates.
       * The configuration of these resources.
       * How it interacts with other stacks (e.g., passing the VPC from the VpcStack to the Ec2Stack).
   5. Analyze Lambda Functions: The lambda/ directory contains the source code for the Lambda functions. For each function, you should:
       * Review the source code to understand its business logic.
       * Check its dependencies in its package.json file.
       * Understand how it is invoked (e.g., via API Gateway).
   6. Review Shared Packages: The packages/ directory contains common code shared across different parts of the application. The
      lambda-common package likely provides useful abstractions and utilities for the Lambda functions.
   7. Check Utility Files: The lib/utils/ directory contains helper functions for naming conventions, tagging, and environment
      management. These are important for maintaining consistency.
   8. Understand Deployment Scripts: The package.json file contains scripts for deploying, destroying, and comparing infrastructure for
      the different environments. These scripts are key to understanding how to manage the application's lifecycle.
